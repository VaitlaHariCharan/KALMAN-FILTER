# KALMAN-FILTER
KALMAN FILTERING FOR ACCURATE ACCELEROMETER AND GYROSCOPE  MEASUREMENTS




The Kalman Filter, a cornerstone of modern estimation theory,
has proven indispensable across an array of disciplines
including control systems, signal processing, navigation, and
more. Its elegant yet powerful nature lies in its capacity to
seamlessly fuse imperfect measurements with predictions
derived from mathematical models, thus enabling the accurate
estimation of a system's underlying state. This comprehensive
report delves into the heart of the Kalman Filter, elucidating its
foundational theory, versatile applications, notable
advantages, and inherent limitations, thereby offering a

comprehensive understanding of its inner workings and real-
world implications.
